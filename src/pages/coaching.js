        <p>If you don't know the answer, then you are there already.</p>
        <p>You see, our happiness depends on 3 factors:‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£</p>
        <ol style={{ textAlign: 'left' }}>
          <li>Past - Satisfaction we draw from our past üï∞ ‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£</li>
          <li>Present - Joy we're experiencing in the present moment ‚ö°Ô∏è‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£</li>
          <li>Future - Hope and optimism for our future üöÄ</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          A therapist can help you deal with the past and make sense of it.‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£
          Your current circumstances dictate how you feel in the present.‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£ But
          as a coach, I focus on the future.
        </p>
        <p>Why?</p>
        <p>
          Because your future is the one factor that you can control - and it
          also happens to be what eventually shapes your past and present ü§Ø‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're not satisfied with where you are, you <em>must</em> take
          charge of your future.
        </p>
        <p>The question is, how? How can you take charge of the future?</p>
        <p>
          The answer can be a tough one to find - and that‚Äôs where I come in as
          a coach.
        </p>
        <p>Are you ready to take control?</p>
