            The satisfaction we draw from our <strong>past</strong> üï∞ ‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£

          <li>

        <p>
          A therapist can help you deal with the <em>past</em> and make sense of
          it.‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£ Your current circumstances dictate how you feel in the{' '}
          <em>present</em>.‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£ But as a coach,{' '}
          <strong>I focus on the future.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Why?</p>
        <p>
          Because your future is the one factor that <em>you</em> can control -
          and it also happens to be what eventually shapes your past and present
          ü§Ø‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're not satisfied with where you are, you <em>must</em> take
          charge of your future.
        </p>
        <p>
          The question is, how? How can you take charge of the future? And the
          answer can be a tough one to find - but that‚Äôs where I come in as a
          coach.

        <h2>What is coaching?</h2>
        <p>
          There are many types of coaches and many types of coaching. The
          general idea of coaching is that it's not about telling you what you
          need to do - rather it's about asking the right questions so that you
          can figure out on your own what it is that you need to do. Why? Two
          reason. First, you're a lot more likely to stay the course and be
          persistent with something if you came up with the answer yourself - as
          opposed to someone spoon feeding it to you. And second, plausible
          deniability.
