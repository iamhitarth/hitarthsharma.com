I just got passed over for a promotion at work that I _believed_ I was a shoo-in for.

And the reasons for it were just as frustrating if not more as the situation itself.

This was the kind of situation where you feel crazy mad because there is no one specifically to get mad at.

So I spent yesterday and most of the day before being mad.

Then, I started feeling tired of being mad.

Must be the old age getting to me or something üòí

So then, I fell asleep.

When I woke up today morning, I felt those feelings rushing right back up.

I deserved that lead spot, I have a ton of experience, I have managed teams way bigger than ours and I just delivered their newest product's first version basically single handedly.

What more could I do?!

I was mad. So mad.

Then I started being mad at other stuff as well. Stupid weather is acting up. Fucking reception lady did not even wish me a good morning and tell me to have a good day.

Everything sucks. I hate everything.

Then, 30 minutes into my day, I started feeling tired again.

So then feeling mad and tired and sitting on the train like:

I realized that what's done is done.

And yes, while I have to do something about it, I can either do those some things while being mad (and probably come across as a crazy mad man) or I could calm the fuck down and go about those same things like a professional.
