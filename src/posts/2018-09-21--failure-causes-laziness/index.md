Why wouldn't you hustle if you were succeeding?

What reason would you have to sit around and procrastinate if you were hitting home runs all around?

It's when you keep failing.

Getting your hopes up and then watching them crash right down like a house of cards.

Repeatedly running into walls, head first.

That's when laziness starts to creep in.

You start thinking.

> Man I deserve a break. I've been working hard and not getting the results I deserve.
>
> The least I deserve is a break.

And then, before you know it, that break turns into an extended vacation.

Which in time, turns into another thing that you quit halfway.
