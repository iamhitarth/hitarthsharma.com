Put pen to paper. Show up every day. Just show up. Don't have to win any battles but just show up. And do the best that you can. THAT day. But then some day you'll have to change. Because while this approach will make you persistent, you still have to put in the effort to deliver.

Does that have to be a conscious thing though? What is you just showed up? And kept doing the same thing over and over. Would your brain be fickle enough to start putting in the real effort as soon as it gets bored? Because you keep showing up. You keep showing up and just don't leave another option on the table for your brain. The only options are to either sit there and get bored or jump in and try some shit. That's it. And being the way our brain is, eventually, it will start putting in the effort - just to break the monotony.

However, before that effort REALLY comes through, it will try to make you quit. It will try to break out of the boring, consistent rhythm by making you stop showing up. This isn't another person we're talking about here. This is your brain. This is you. You know yourself. Your deepest darkest fear. And so when I say it will try to make you quit - it really will throw anything and everything at you. Even take advantage of those fears of yours. If being injured is what you're afraid of, you'll just hear a whisper in your head. You feel tired today, don't go.. what if you get injured again? Feel sick today. Feel tired today. Don't feel up to it. Don't feel I should be pushing myself today. There will be as many reasons as there are stars in the sky - to quit. To not show up. It will be super tempting to quit. Because your brain isn't the only one that suffers from the mental discomfort of of showing up. You do as well. And it's tough. So many potential ways to relieve that mental discomfort. So many options. So why wouldn't you go for it? Why wouldn't you break from the monotony? Why wouldn't you just chase after the next shiny thing? What's stopping you? Nothing. So it's a lost cause then?

Well the redemption comes from the fact that at the end of it all, the decision has to be made by you. You are the only one who can decide whether you show up or not. yes, there are a tonne of other external influences. But that's exactly what they are. Influences. They can influence but they can't make the choice for you. Only you can. And only you will.
So step 1, start identifying those decision points. Just identify them. Don't have to do anything else. Just call them out to yourself. Make a game of it. See how many you can call out in a day. In a week.

Now this is where it gets meta. As soon as you start calling them out, initially you'll start judging yourself but then eventually, you'll get bored of just calling them out. So maybe the next time you call it out, you'll do something just a little bit different. You'll make just a slightly different decision than usual. Then a couple more. Then a couple more on top of the previous couple. Then before you know it, you start noticing the difference in what and how you feel when you make a different decisions. So now its not just a different decision you're going for. You're actually gunning for a different outcome as well. Because now you've had a taste. Now you know what sacrificing that instant gratification results in further down the line. And once you've tasted that a couple of times, now you've got a craving for it. And there are very few forces in the universe stronger than a craving. And now with this craving on your side, now, you've really got some momentum and so every time you just call out a decision point in your head, all you need to do to make the right decision is to tap into the craving for it. And initially it will be a conscious decision to do so but do it seven times and before you know it, it will become automatic. Decision point -> craving for result from right decision -> right decision.

But all this depends on the assumption that you know what the result feels like. If you're trying to push yourself in a direction where you haven't experienced any results yet, then how can you go about it?
