> Anybody can feel good when they have their health, their bills are paid, they have happy
> relationships. Anybody can be positive then. Anybody can have a larger vision then. Anybody can
> have faith under those kinds of circumstances.
>
> The real challenge of growth mentally, emotionally and spiritually comes when you get knocked
> down. It takes courage to act. Part of being hungry when you have been defeated, it takes courage
> to start over again.
