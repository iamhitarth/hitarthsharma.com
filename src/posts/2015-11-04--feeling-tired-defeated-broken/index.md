It's hard to keep going.
<blockquote>Anybody can feel good when they have their health, their bills are paid, they have happy relationships. Anybody can be positive then. Anybody can have a larger vision then. Anybody can have faith under those kinds of circumstances.

The real challenge of growth mentally, emotionally and spiritually comes when you get knocked down. It takes courage to act. Part of being hungry when you have been defeated, it takes courage to start over again.</blockquote>
Watch this 5-minute video to get the inspiration to keep going. To push through. To grow. To bounce <em>forward</em> from your setbacks, stronger than ever.
