Think about how to do better. But don't put pressure on yourself.

Expect things to go wrong. Suggestions to get turned down. Projects to fall through. People to get annoyed.

But also expect to learn from it all.

As long as you learn from something, its not a failure. Its a lesson learnt, an insight gained and a chance to try again and do better.

Yet its important to not be reckless. If you break your hand, the bone will grow back stronger. Yet if you break your neck, you will be dead.

Mistakes are good as long as they are not fatal. You want to live to fight another day.

> Lesson learnt, insight gained. Chance to try again and do better.

If the situation is make or break, its very easy to abandon this learning attitude. Panic sets in and all you can think about is how to get shit done. That's good though. That can help you focus.

Where the learning attitude really shines is _after_ the "thing" is done. But till its done, just direct your full energy and attention on succeeding.

Sometimes you win, every time you learn - as long as you try your hardest. Otherwise, you will keep learning what you already know - "I should have tried harder".
