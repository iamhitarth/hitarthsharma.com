It's interesting to read all this personal development stuff but struggle to see the return on investment on it in real life.

The logic of whatever you're reading seems to be clear - when it's the only thing you're reading. Combine that with all the other stuff you've read, seen or heard though and it becomes so much harder to figure out which way to go.

There is a saying about how it doesn't matter which road you take, if you don't know where you want to go. However, lets say you know where you want to go. The only catch is that there are multiple ways to get there. Which road would you pick then? And, to add to the confusion, you constantly see, read or hear about different people doing it in different ways.

Maybe it just goes to show that the road doesn't matter. What matters is the type of person you are. Bill Gates quit school, Zuckerberg didn't. They both changed the world.

You have to be the type of person who can make the most of opportunities and obstacles available to you. And yes, you can - in fact, you must - _use_ the obstacles "available" to you.

Think of it like training for jumping using a real hurdle vs without it. Which will give you the better results?
