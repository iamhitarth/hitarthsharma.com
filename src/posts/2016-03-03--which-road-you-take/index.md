It's interesting to read all this stuff but struggle to see the return on investment on it in real life.

The logic of whatever you're reading seems to clear - when it's the only thing you're reading. But when that gets combined with all the other stuff you've have read/seen/heard, it becomes so much harder to understand which way to go.

There is a saying about how it doesn't matter which road you take, if you don't know where you want to go. However, which road would you pick if you saw that there are multiple roads you can take to get to where you want? And, to add to the confusion, you see/hear/read about different people doing it in different ways.

Maybe it shows that it doesn't matter what road you take - what matters is the type of person you are. Bill Gates quit school, Zuckerberg didn't. They both killed it.

End of the day you have to be the type of person who can make the most of opportunities/obstacles available to you to get to where you want to get to. And yes, you can - in fact, you must - _use_ the obstacles "available" to you.

Think of it like training for jumping using a real hurdle vs without it. Which will give you the better results?
