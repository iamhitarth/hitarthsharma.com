To title or not to title is the question. Are titles a bad thing? I don't know but maybe that is because I am biased due to being on the brink of a title change. In my opinion (right now) a title matters because it symbolises who you are. It makes people perceive you a certain way.

Can that be a bad thing? Absolutely. But is it always a bad thing? Hell no. Just like everything else, a title change is another tool that you can use to help you do your job better. To make it crystal clear, its up to you to decide whether the title helps you or holds you back. Whether the title boxes you in and pigeon holes you or whether it guarantees that you will - at the very least - get to do the work you like.

A title can make your job easier by helping people perceive you in the way you want them to but the key word to note is "help". THere is no title in the world that can help you if you are incompetent at your job or if you aren't giving it your all. Yet being able to control people's perceptions through just a few words can be incredibly powerful. Your organization might not believe in titles but that fact is irrelevant because people believe in them and people are the ones who make up an organization.
