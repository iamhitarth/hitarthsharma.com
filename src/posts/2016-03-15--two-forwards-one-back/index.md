Is it possible to constantly keep moving forward? Or does it always have to be a case of two steps forward, one step back?

My personal experience has always been the latter. In fact, sometimes it has even ended up being one step forward, two steps back. And while that may be better than no steps forward, all steps back, in the end the difference is trivial as in both cases you are moving back.

So why is it that we crave for all steps forward, no steps back? Well I suspect part of the reason might be the lack of a learner's mindset (growth mindset). Plus a conditioning that leaves us craving for success - "the event", instead of success - "the journey".

And being unable to step back and look at things in the long term is probably the third reason that round off the trio of things that leave us disappointed in ourselves. In the world and people around us.

I suspect most of us fall in the middle two categories yet we end up feeling that others fall into the all steps forward, no steps back category.

However, the only reason for that is that most people are very good at hiding their steps back and highlighting their steps forward. But there is one major difference between the middle 2 categories. In one people chase momentary progress whereas in the other long term progress matters more.
