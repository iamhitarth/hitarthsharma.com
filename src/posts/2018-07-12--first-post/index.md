My first post on this new blog is going to be about the beginning of new things.

And how we have to end the old things in order to start the new ones.

It's tempting to hold on to the old while reaching for the new.

But if you're aiming high. Really high. As high as you should be aiming.

Then, getting to the new while holding to the old will not be possible.

You will have to let go of the old to be able to reach the new.
