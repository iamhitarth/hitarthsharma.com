TODO: Should probably jump right into it - instead of drawing it out. Can give away the questions and then draw it out.

When was the last time you started questioning things?

When that voice in the back of your head started wondering... am I doing the right thing? or am I really just wasting my time?

It starts out as a whisper that you manage to supress - sometimes.

In time though, it starts feeling like someone is yelling right in your ear.

> WHAT THE FUCK are you doing wasting your time here?

You try to talk back - but you know it's an uphill battle.

In those times, two questions are all you need.

Two questions to lay all this to rest.

Whether you like the answer or not is a different question - but it works ðŸ’¯

> Am I proud of/happy about what I am doing?

Or whatever it is that you are thinking of doing.

> Will doing this allow me to do something that I am proud of/happy about?

That's it.

If the answer to neither of those questions is yes, then you need to either find something else to do.

Or, you need to find happiness in what you're doing.
