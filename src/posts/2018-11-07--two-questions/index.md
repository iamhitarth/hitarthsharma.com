I spend a lot of time being unsure of where I am heading and where my life is heading and what's purpose etc.

The result of doing so means that I frequently find myself questioning the decisions I made in the past that got me to where I am.

Am I doing the right thing? Am I wasting my time? Should I do that totally random thing from the left field that I saw some guy on YouTube talking about and think I'd be good at?

So as you can imagine, that results in some pretty anxious times.

Because of that I am constantly on the look out for things that will allow me to not get bothered by my brain suddenly encountering and throwing up new options.

Something that I recently stumbled upon was this simple test mentioned by Ryan Holiday on Impact Theory

When was the last time you started questioning things?

When that voice in the back of your head started wondering... am I doing the right thing? or am I really just wasting my time?

It starts out as a whisper that you manage to supress - sometimes.

In time though, it starts feeling like someone is yelling right in your ear.

> WHAT THE FUCK are you doing wasting your time here?

You try to talk back - but you know it's an uphill battle.

In those times, two questions are all you need.

Two questions to lay all this to rest.

Whether you like the answer or not is a different question - but it works ðŸ’¯

> Am I proud of/happy about what I am doing?

Or whatever it is that you are thinking of doing.

> Will doing this allow me to do something that I am proud of/happy about?

That's it.

If the answer to neither of those questions is yes, then you need to either find something else to do.

Or, you need to find happiness in what you're doing.
