Listening to music can make you feel a certain way.

Inspired. Overwhelmed with emotion. Swooning with nostalgia. Hit hard by memories. Memories felt deep. Deep inside.

It's a crazy thing if you think about it.

Waves going into your head trigger a rush of chemicals in your brain that start unravelling your past in front of you - whether you want it or not.

Isn't that amazing? Isn't that crazy?

I don't know where I was going with that but I felt like I had to write something. Had to say something.

It inspired me to say something.

Inspired me to frantically start thinking about how can I make others feel this way.

How can I create something that which when it goes into other people's brains will result in a similar rush of chemicals - maybe being the jumping off point for a chain of such rushes.
