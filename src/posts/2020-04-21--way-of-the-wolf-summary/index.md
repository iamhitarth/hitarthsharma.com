These are my summarized notes from the book Way of the Wolf written by Jordan Belfort (JB) - the _real_ Wolf of Wall Street.

### The Three Tens

The three tens are measures of certainty (on a scale of 1-10) that form the foundational blocks for JB's system of of selling called the Straight Line System.

- The product, idea or concept - does the prospect love the product?
- You, trust and connect with you - do they love you?
- The company that stands behind you - do they love who/what you represent?

People buy stuff that they _think_ will make their life better. That's positive intent. But you can have positive intent and still not have the sale if the prospect doesn't trust you.

There's that saying - people will only **buy from you if they know you, like you and trust you**.

Knowing this helps you gauge the "lay of the land" so to speak - what follows is how to move from there to all (three) tens.

### Concepts for moving ahead

**Future pacing** - when you paint a picture of a future where they've bought your product and can see themselves using the product and feeling good as a result of that. This allows them to experience the amazing the benefits of the product _right now_.

People buy on emotion and then justify their decision with logic. This extends to the fact that there are **two types of certainty** - logical and emotional.

Objections are smoke screens for uncertainty on one, two or all of the "Three Tens" i.e. when a prospect gives you an objection to moving ahead with the sale, the real reason is that they're not sure about one or more of the three tens - the product, you or what you represent. The objection is just a non-confrontational way for them to bow out gracefully.

It's essentially a "straight line" from opening of a sales conversation to the close of it and generally the prospect tries to take us off that straight line by throwing objections. Remember - whenever you find yourself talking about things irrelevant to the sale, you're moving away from the straight line.

### The First Step - Gathering Intelligence

The first step in any sale - whether you're selling a pen to me or a car - is to gather intelligence.

1. Identify the prospect's needs and problems - core and secondary
2. Identify their core beliefs - not being comfortable doing coaching over Zoom or not a fan of working remotely etc.
3. Past experiences with other similar products
4. Values - what are the things that are most important for them? Money? Growth?
5. Financial standards - what's their level of wealth? What's their spending ability to make themselves feel good?
6. Where the pain lies - the things that keep them up at night
7. Identify where they stand financially - how liquid they are etc.

### Basic Tenets of Straight Line

1. Take immediate control of the sale. You have 4 seconds for this.
2. Massive intelligence gathering while building rapport.
3. Transition into presentation while building certainty on each of the three tens.

> Most people have nothing special and you were like them as well but the moment you started learning this, you started acquiring something special and with that because you have something special now, your past doesn't matter anymore. Your past was shit because you didn't have this something special - but now that you do, the world is your oyster.

### Looping

Circling back to the presentation every time you get hit with an objection to gradually increase the level of certainty of a prospect till they get to all tens and give up on objections is called "looping".

### Action Threshold

The level of certainty an individual needs to be at when they decide to take action and give you the sale is their action threshold.

- Different for individuals.
- Depends on the person's beliefs.
- It's malleable - not set in stone - which means that we can bring it lower.

### Pain Threshold

The amount of pain the prospect feels without our product. The more we can raise that (or the feeling of it), the better the chances of a sale because pain creates an urgency so if we can position ourselves as a solution for that pain and then crank up the urgency, the sale comes closer.

### 5 Core Elements of the Straight Line System

1. Prospect must love your product
2. Prospect must trust and connect with you
3. Prospect must trust and connect with what/who you represent (your company)
4. Lower the action threshold
5. Raise the pain threshold

Think of yourself as a safecracker going at a safe with 5 numbers. Start with the first number as you hear a click for each number, try to open the safe, it works, that's great. If not, then start with the next number - a.k.a Looping.

### 4 seconds to take control of the sale

The three things you need to establish about yourself in the prospect's mind within the first 4 seconds:

1. Sharp as a tack
2. Enthusiastic as hell
3. An expert in your field

All of which amounts to the conclusion in the prospect's head that _you're worth listening to_.

This becomes all the more important given that fact that if you make a first negative impression, it takes 8 positive impressions after that to erase that one negative impression.

From the prospect's POV establishing the 3 things above tells them that you're going to:

1. Get to the point quickly.
2. Not waste their time.
3. Have a solution to their problem.
4. Be an asset to them over the long term.

All of that extrapolates to "you can help them achieve their goal" which in turn means (in their heads) "you can help them get what they want in life".

Note that your tone of voice matters the most when it comes to how you're perceived. With in person interactions, body language matters a lot as well.
