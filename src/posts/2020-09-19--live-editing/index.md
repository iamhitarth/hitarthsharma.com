Awesome. This works!

Also super cool how I can edit stuff from my phone. Now if I can just add an image, things will be perfect üëåüèº

Okay so looks like I didn't lose all my changes. So that's good. But still. It felt a bit w

Was going to say feels a bit weird because it keeps reloading and doesn't really stop - maybe its the 1 seconds timeout thing. Looks like that's exactly what it was.

I added a 5 seconds timeout now so I wonder if that's going to make a difference. Is it 5 seconds after I stop typing?

Yeahhh boi looks like that's the one - feels like 3 seconds might be a better time.

But regardless it is probably going to be annoying when I stop typing and start again only to have this thing reload.

Changed the time so that now it's 3 seconds. But its not loading at all... 

Also apparently I was using the wrong variable... there's something about hammering the Gatsby build server. By default it gets 1 second. But right now it's getting 3 so that works better for it I guess.
