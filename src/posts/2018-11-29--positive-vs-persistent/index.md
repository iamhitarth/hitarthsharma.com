Positive attitude vs persistence - is there a difference? What is the difference? Is one better than the other? Are both useful? Where are they both useful? How can one cultivate one or the other? Can they be cultivated? What are some example situations? When does one prevail over the other one? Is there a difference between how this applies to individuals vs teams?

"Wtf is the difference?" - my initial reaction reading about this in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6963194-art-of-manipulation" target="_blank">Art of Manipulation by R. B. Sparkman</a>.

Persistence is the ability to keep going when the going gets tough. And, having a positive attitude will allow me to do that, right? Right?

    Well, yes, no and maybe.

### Yes

A positive attitude - or keeping your chin up - is having hope that things will eventually, hopefully, work out. And hope of a better future can certainly keep you going - which in essence is persistence - the ability to keep going.

So from that perspective a positive attitude _can_ help you be more persistent indeed.

### No

However, the problem is what happens when you get knocked on the head a couple of times and your positive attitude decides to go on a vacation.

If they haven't worked out, then it's not the end.
