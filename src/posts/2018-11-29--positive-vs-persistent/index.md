Once upon a time, there was a donkey.

He was a bit of a stupid donkey. I mean, the other donkeys certainly thought so. Even the farmer who owned him thought so.

One day, the farmer was doing his afternoon rounds, checking his crops, when he heard braying in the distance - hee-haw! hee-haw!

Almost instantly the farmer knew that it must be his stupid donkey, upto no good. So he followed the sound of hee-haw! hee-haw! and it led him to an old abandoned well just on the edge of his farm.

When he looked down into the well, lo and behold, he saw the stupid donkey stuck there. Running around in circles, hee-haw! hee-haw!-ing away.

Now the farmer was pissed off. First, the stupid donkey does not do anything useful and then on top of that, he decides to get stuck in a freakin' well out of all places. And to top it all off, he won't stop hee-haw! hee-haw!-ing until the farmer manages to pull him out üò°

So mad and annoyed, the farmer somehow manages to convince his mates up in the village to come down and help him get the donkey out.

While they're walking down to the well with shovels and ropes, the farmer realizes that maybe he can get rid of his stupid donkey problem once and for all.

_Maybe_, just maybe he can get them to bury the donkey in the well and have one less problem to deal with for the rest of eternity üëø

So the farmer and his friends get to the well and start shoving dirt into the well to bury the donkey.

At first, the farmer sees the donkey hee-haw! hee-haw!-ing more than ever and running around in panic. But then after a little while, the hee-haw!-ing stops so curious to see if the donkey has been buried, the farmer looks inside the well. To his surprise he sees the donkey looking up at him - standing on top of all the dirt that they've been showing down the well üò≤

The farmer realizes that at first the donkey tried running around but then just started dodging the dirt and staying on top of it to get closer to the top of the well.

With this the farmer realizes that maybe the donkey is not so stupid after all and so decides to try and rescue him

It's same as the difference between having a positive attitude vs being persistent.

Are the two different?

Positive attitude vs persistence - is there a difference? What is the difference? Is one better than the other? Are both useful? Where are they both useful? How can one cultivate one or the other? Can they be cultivated? What are some example situations? When does one prevail over the other one?

Those are the questions to be answered but what story can they be wrapped within? Maybe the story worth using is one of persistence.

This is one of my favourite stories. I first read it a couple of years ago when it perfectly described a group that I was managing at the time. We had just come through a challenging period and this became our theme that illustrated our victory against the odds.

So, what‚Äôs the story of the Donkey and the Well?

Once upon a time, there was a donkey.

It was a stupid, stubborn old donkey and even the farmer who owned it didn‚Äôt like him.

The farmer owned a large property and one day he heard in the distance the loud, distinctive ‚Äúeye-ore, eye-ore‚Äù of the donkey. He wondered what the stupid donkey had done now, so he looked all over his property until at last he found the animal at the bottom of an old abandoned well.

Exasperated, the farmer rang his neighbours and asked them each to bring a shovel. He‚Äôd had enough of the stupid donkey, so he had decided to bury it in the well.

All of his friends came over and together they started to shovel dirt into the well. At first, the donkey protested loudly, braying with all of his might, but after about 10 minutes, he stopped.

The farmers kept shovelling.

After a while, someone decided to have a look into the well to see what had happened to the donkey. What he saw astonished him.

Instead of being buried, the donkey would dodge the incoming dirt, standing on the ever-increasing mound.

Now the mission changed and the farmers went from trying to bury the donkey to trying to save him, shovelling more and more dirt into the abandoned well until he jumped out of the top victorious.

Upon his release, the farmers all dropped their shovels and applauded the old stubborn beast with a newfound admiration.

There are times in life when it seems as though we are that donkey. Trapped and feeling as though life is trying to bury us. Don‚Äôt go under, but continue to find a way to overcome your challenges one at a time until you too emerge victorious.
