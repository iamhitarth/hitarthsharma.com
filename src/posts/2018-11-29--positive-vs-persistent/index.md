Positive attitude vs persistence - is there a difference? What is the difference? Is one better than the other? Are both useful? Where are they both useful? How can one cultivate one or the other? Can they be cultivated? What are some example situations? When does one prevail over the other one? Is there a difference between how this applies to individuals vs teams?

"Wtf is the difference?" - my initial reaction reading about this in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6963194-art-of-manipulation" target="_blank">Art of Manipulation by R. B. Sparkman</a>.

Persistence is the ability to keep going when the going gets tough. And, having a positive attitude will allow me to do that, right? Right?

    Well, yes, no, maybe!

### Yes

A positive attitude - or keeping your chin up - is having hope that things will eventually, hopefully, work out. And hope of a better future can certainly keep you going - which in essence is persistence - the ability to keep going.

So from that perspective a positive attitude _can_ help you be more persistent indeed.

### No

However, the problem is that when life decides to deliver a one-two combination right to your face, your positive attitude decides to go on a vacation.

At that point, if a positive attitude is all you had going for you, then it's lights out. It's a wrap. See ya later, alligator. Time to go home. Time to step aside and let someone else handle the jandal.

On the other hand, when you're persistent, you essentially go into situations with the mindset that if things haven't worked out then it's not the end. Plain and simple.

So while going into something you might feel like you're fucked, and life is like take this and that and this again. If you just manage to hang on, you just might end up on top - and that is what persistence is about.
Have a couple of gifs of a fighter getting tonked and then have a third gif with the fighter winning at the end.

The ability to hang in there and not give up, while you're the anvil and then strike with full force when it's your turn to be the hammer - that's persistence.

### Maybe

Just like with most other non-trivial things in life though, "it depends". A positive attitude and persistence _can_ go hand in hand. _Sometimes_.

There are scenarios and situations where a positive attitude can work wonders - like the movie scenarios where a speech fires up a handful of soldiers, allowing them to beat a much biggera and sizeable army. Or, in team sports, where having a positive attitude is an infectious thing that can influence others around you in to being positive when the chips are down and vice versa - thus creating an atmosphere where the whole group becomes persistent as a result of the positive attitude.

But at an individual level, positive attitude is not worth much. If you're just positive but not persistent, you're fucked.

Postivity vs persistence is like style vs substance
